# Pokemon-Identifier
An experimental pipeline was built to classify genuine Pok√©mon cards versus counterfeits using convolutional neural networks. A labeled image dataset was augmented with random flips, rotations, zooms, and contrast adjustments to improve generalization. Transfer learning with a frozen pretrained MobileNetV2 network was used to train a lightweight classification head on these augmented images. The resulting model reached roughly **89 % training accuracy** and **81.1 % validation accuracy** with a final validation loss of about **0.48**, confirming its ability to distinguish real cards from fakes.
